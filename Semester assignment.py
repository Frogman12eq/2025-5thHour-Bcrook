#Due to weird time travelling circumstances beyond explanation, you find yourself in 2018 or so
#working for Larian Studios. Currently, they are working on the early prototypes of the hype
#upcoming game "Baldur's Gate 3". BG3 is a game that uses the Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition rules
#as its framework for gameplay. You have been given a basic dictionary of some of the main hero
#characters and some of the enemies they may face, and are tasked with making an early prototype
#of one of the party members fighting against an enemy until one of them hits zero HP (dies).

#Combat consists of these steps:

#1. Rolling for 'initiative' to see who goes first. This is determined by rolling a
#20-sided die (d20) and adding their initiative modifier (If the roll is the same,
#assume the hero goes first).
hero_init_roll= random.randint(1,20) + (partyDict["Astarion"]["Init"])

elif villain_init_roll > hero_init_roll:
    print("Villain goes first")
else:
    print("Hero goes first")
villain_health = (enemyDict["Dragon"]["HP"]) + (enemyDict["Dragon"]["AC"])
#2. Rolling to attack. This is determined by rolling a 20-sided die (d20) and adding their
#attack modifier. The attack hits if it matches or is higher than the target's Armor Class (AC).
#If the d20 rolled to attack is an unmodified ("natural") 20, the attack automatically hits and
#the character deals double damage. If the d20 rolled to attack is an unmodified ("natural") 1,
#the attack automatically misses
hero_atk_roll= random.randint(1,20)
if hero_atk_roll == 20:
    print("Automatic hit, that's a critical")
elif hero_atk_roll == 1:
    print("Aw shucks that's a critical failure")
elif hero_atk_roll + (partyDict["Astarion"]["AtkMod"]) >= (enemyDict["Dragon"]["AC"]):
    print("That's a hit")
        print(villain_health)
else:
    print("That's a miss")
print(hero_atk_roll)

#3. If the attack hits, roll damage and subtract it from the target's hit points.

#4. The second in initiative rolls to attack (and rolls damage) afterwards.

#5. Repeat steps 2-5 until one of the characters is dead
